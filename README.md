# LaunchBar Test Repo 

This is a test repo for a new LaunchBar action. The idea of the action is to check local repos for updates, pull them, and then run my [Local Action Updates action](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Local-Action-Updates). The action complements the approach that the Local Action Updates action is following. 

A better solution would probably be a standalone app, something like [Latest](https://max.codes/latest/) but for LaunchBar actions. But this action pair is all I can offer.

If you want to help me test, let me know. One way to help is by forking this and adding an `lbaction` bundle to this repo.

[You can find the new action in my main repo.](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/LB-Repo-Updates)

Thanks!
